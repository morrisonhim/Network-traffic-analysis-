# Network-traffic-analysis-
This project demonstrates how to capture, inspect and analyze network traffic using Wireshark. The goal was to understand packet structures, identify communication patterns, and detect potential anomalies within a simulated network
# Project Overview
This project demonstrates how i used Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic to understand communication patterns, identify suspicious packets, and gain insights into network behavior.
# Tools used
~ Wireshark
~ Windows
# Steps I followed
1. Installed Wireshark on my machine
2. Selected the network interface and started a live capture
3. Observed live traffic flow and applied filters such as:
